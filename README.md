# Teams-Startup
A script to only start Microsoft Teams on system start if it is a weekday.

**NOTE:** This only works on Windows 10!
# Installation
1) Download the Python file.
2) Make sure you have [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.7/python-3.8.7-embed-amd64.zip) installed on your PC. (Anything 3.6+ should work, but it has only been tested on 3.8)
3) Double click the __Teams-Startup-Setup.py__ file, and the script will automatically copy itself to your startup folder.
4) Disable Teams.exe from loading using Task Manager.
